### Key Technologies
- **Manifest V3**: Latest Chrome extension standard
- **Chrome Tabs & Scripting API**: Page detection, messaging, and auto-scroll
- **Accessibility**: ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management

### Architecture
1. **Content Script**: Scans X.com pages for bookmark URLs
2. **Popup Interface**: Main user interaction and results display

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All bookmark extraction happens in your browser
- **No Data Collection**: Extension doesn't collect or transmit personal data
- **No API Keys**: No configuration or external services required
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only `tabs`, `activeTab`, `clipboardWrite`, and `scripting` are used

## üêõ Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

#### User Interface
- Light mode only (dark mode coming soon)
- Basic progress indication (visual progress bar coming soon)
- Limited configuration options (settings panel planned)
- Fixed popup width (responsive design planned)

#### Functionality
- Re-extraction needed for different export formats (persistent storage coming)
- No built-in search or filtering (advanced search planned)
- Manual bookmark deletion only (batch operations planned)
- No bookmark organization features (tags and categories coming)
- Limited export formats (PDF and integration support planned)
- No media export support (image and video export planned)

#### Technical
- Limited to Chrome browser currently (Firefox/Safari support coming)
- Basic error recovery (enhanced error handling planned)
- Monolithic code structure (modularization planned)
- Limited performance metrics (enhanced monitoring coming)

### Performance Considerations
- Large bookmark sets (>500) may require batched processing
- Auto-scroll speed limited to prevent rate limiting
- Memory usage increases with bookmark count
- Network-dependent performance

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome: Full support
- Firefox: Coming soon
- Safari: Coming soon
- Other Chromium browsers: Untested

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- Make sure you are on the X Bookmarks page (`https://x.com/i/bookmarks`) when scanning.
- If scanning fails, refresh the page and try again.
- If you see no results, scroll down to load more bookmarks or use "Auto-Scroll & Scan All".
- If clipboard copy fails, the extension will select the text for you‚Äîjust press `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C` to copy manually.
- If you have more than 500 bookmarks, consider exporting in batches for best performance.
- All errors and statuses are shown in the status bar at the top of the popup.

## ‚ôø Accessibility

- All buttons and textareas are keyboard accessible and have ARIA labels.
- Status bar uses `role=status` and `aria-live` for screen readers.
- Focus outlines are strong and visible.
- Logical tab order for all interactive elements.
